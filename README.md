# cognition

## Cognition is an expert systems' shell, that allows to detect the most influent nodes in the graph

### Instructions

#### Visual Studio build:

1. Open Cognition.sln in your Visual Studio IDE.
2. Build solution.
3. Math modules and Cognition program will appear in the bin/ folder.

#### Cognition program usage:

1. There is a built solution in the Example/ folder (Example/Cognition.exe) or you can build Cognition solution in your Visual Studio IDE (as we talked above).
2. Run Cognition.exe.
3. Load matrix, that you need to compute. Use "Load matrix" button. Or you can create your own matrix by creating Custom verticles and setting Impact and Influence values for these verticles.
4. Press "Calculate" button.
5. Our math module will calculate Components of Response/Impact vectors, Effectiveness index and Controllability-ensuring index.
